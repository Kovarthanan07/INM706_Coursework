Heartbeat Anomaly Detection
Course: INM706 - Deep Learning for Sequence Analysis
Program: MSc in Artificial Intelligence
University: City, University of London

üìù Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting abnormal heartbeats using deep learning models applied to ECG data. The objective is to support early diagnosis of cardiovascular abnormalities through unsupervised learning techniques. Two architectures are compared:

1D Convolutional Autoencoder

LSTM Autoencoder

The models are evaluated based on reconstruction error to identify anomalies in ECG signals.
